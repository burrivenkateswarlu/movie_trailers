## student at Narasaraopeta Engineering College
A simple movie trailer website project for Udacity's full-stack nanodegree program. The project demonstrates the use of a Movie object class in Python to generate a static webpage, which displays a listing of favorite movies and links each movie to its trailers video on YouTube. The project also includes some CSS and jQuery involved in the display of the webpage.

## Quick Start
After downloading the project files, a movie trailer page can be created by importing media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py at the start of your Python script. Then create idividual Movie objects by calling media.Movie() and supplying it with four arguments --> title, year, poster_url, and trailer_url. Lastly, to generate the movie trailers page, call fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page() and supply it with an array of the movie objects you created.
